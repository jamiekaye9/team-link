Description: 

Team Link is an HR Management application. A user of the application has the option to join an existing company or create their own. When assigned to a company, a user has the ability to create and edit their workforce. The idea for this app came from my experience implementing Workday in my current job. I was inspired to design the processes and functionality that I have previously only learnt about from a front end perspective.

Attributions: 

To build this application, I used Canva to create a transparent logo

Technologies used: 

JavaScript, EJS, CSS, MongoDB, Bcrypt, Express

Next Steps: 

There are many additions than can be made to this app to increase its functionality. One idea would be to give the admin of a company the access to delete other users. Another might be to have notifications appear on the page if a worker is no longer assigned to a manager.
